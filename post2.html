    <p>Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we work, and writing is no exception. AI-powered tools can generate drafts, suggest edits, and even create entire articles. But where do these tools fit into the craft of technical writing? This piece explores how AI can assist writers without replacing the human touch.</p>
    <p>From code documentation to user manuals, clear communication is essential. AI tools can analyze large volumes of text and spot inconsistencies, ensuring that documentation is accurate and easy to follow. They can also help translate technical jargon into accessible language, making complex topics understandable for broader audiences.</p>
    <p>While AI accelerates certain tasks, the role of the writer remains crucial. Creativity, empathy, and contextual understanding are uniquely human traits that cannot be fully automated. Writers who embrace AI as a collaborative tool will find new efficiencies while retaining their voice and vision.</p>
    <p>Incorporating AI into your workflow doesn’t mean giving up control. It means leveraging technology to enhance your skills and focus on what truly matters: telling stories that resonate.</p>
